### Task

The goal of this assignment is to allow you to demonstrate your programming skills and to illustrate your approach when developing a mobile application.

Your app should be production ready - in addition to assessing your code quality, I will be trying to break your app by testing for different usability issues that a real user might encounter. Your task is to implement an exchange rates app. The app must request and update currency rates every second using an API.

Users should be able to:

- Add a new currency pair;
- Remove a currency pair.

The list of currency pairs should be preserved across application launches.

### Code requirements

- Please use the latest stable Xcode + Swift;
- Avoid use of third-party libraries such as [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift). I would prefer to see a vanilla approach so I can see you understand the underlying concepts. We do use third-party libraries at Accenture, of course, but for the purposes of this test, please avoid doing so;
- Please ensure your application has good test coverage;
- Structured and clear commit history.

### What I am looking for:

- Clarity, elegance, and maintainability of code;
- Code consistency. Please refer to a community maintained style guide if you’re unsure;
- A clear architecture and adherence to iOS design patterns;
- Knowledge of the iOS human interface guidelines;
- Appropriate application of relevant native iOS frameworks (Foundation, UIKit, SwiftUI);
- Good code coverage with Unit tests.

### What I don’t want to see:

- Overengineered code;
- Copy-pasted chunks that you don't entirely understand;
- Lack of Unit testing.
